# Goals/Outcomes ✨

- To test knowledge of consuming APIs and handling responses
- Loading state and knowing where and how to make multiple API calls efficiently

&nbsp;

# Pre-requisites ✅

- Add your Spotify client ID & secret to a `.env` file in root using the environment variables
- https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/

`REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`

- Note. **Never add this type of config to version control. This would usually come from your build server.**

&nbsp;

# Requirements 📖

- Fetch and display _Released This Week_ songs
  - Use the API path `new-releases`
- Fetch and display _Featured Playlists_
  - Use the API path `featured-playlists`
- Fetch and display _Browse_ genres
  - Use the API path `categories`
- Loading state/UI _(optional, current UX is already clean)_

&nbsp;

# Think about 💡

- Taking a look at the Spotify API documentation
- Do you resolve each API request one after the other or in parallel?
- Where do you make the API requests?
- How much logic do you offload out of the UI components?

&nbsp;

# What's Already Been Done 🏁

- UI/UX for all elements, including previews (mobile responsive)
